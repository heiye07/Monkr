## Why Monkr?

Most mockup tools are either bloated desktop apps, locked behind subscriptions, or require uploading your screenshots to someone else's server. **Monkr is different** - it's a fast, privacy-first mockup generator that runs 100% in your browser. No accounts, no uploads, no watermarks.

Drop in a screenshot, pick a device, choose a background, and download a polished mockup in seconds. Need App Store screenshots? Animated previews? Multi-device compositions? Monkr handles it all.

## Features

### 20+ Device Frames

Pixel-perfect frames for the devices people actually use:

| Category | Devices |
|----------|---------|
| **iPhone** | 18 Pro Max, 18 Pro & iPhone Duo — inner/outer, folded & unfolded — (official Apple bezels); 17 Pro Max, 17 Pro, 17 Air, 17, 16 Pro Max, 16 Pro, 16 Plus, 16, 15 series, 14 series |
| **Android** | Pixel 7 Pro, Nothing Phone |
| **iPad** | Pro (M5) 13" & 11" (official Apple bezels), Pro 13", Pro 11", Air, Mini |
| **Mac** | MacBook Pro 16", MacBook Air M2, MacBook Air 13" |
| **Desktop** | iMac M4 24" & MacBook Neo (official Apple bezels), iMac 24", iMac Pro, Pro Display XDR |
| **Watch** | Apple Watch Series 11 46mm, Apple Watch Ultra 3 49mm — official Apple product bezels (see [docs/APPLE-BEZELS.md](docs/APPLE-BEZELS.md)) |
| **Misc** | Apple Studio Display / Studio Display XDR 2026 (official Apple bezels, marketing frames only — no ASC screenshot type) |
| **Other** | Apple TV 4K, Flat Screen TV, Browser (Light & Dark) |

Each device includes multiple color variants and can be freely positioned, scaled, rotated, and tilted in 3D.

Official Apple product-bezel frames are kept in sync with
[Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) by
`npm run sync-bezels` — it discovers every published `Bezel-*.dmg`, diffs
against `static/devices/manifest.json`, measures the screen cutouts, and
generates registry entries + mask SVGs automatically. A new device class
shows up on its own — the run flags anything a human must decide (a frame
with more than one screen, a cutout no App Store screenshot size fits, a
folding device) instead of importing it silently. See
[docs/APPLE-BEZELS.md](docs/APPLE-BEZELS.md) for the workflow, flags, and
license notes.

### Backgrounds That Pop

- **30+ gradient presets** - Cosmic, warm, cool, nature, pastel, neon, and mesh gradients
- **100+ curated images** - Abstract, cosmic, earth, holographic, mystic, glass, radiant, vintage, and classic macOS wallpapers (Big Sur through Tahoe)
- **Solid colors** with full color picker
- **Transparent** backgrounds for compositing
- **Trim transparent edges** when exporting a transparent PNG to remove empty canvas space around the visible mockup
- **Custom uploads** - drag & drop any image
- **Unsplash integration** - search millions of free photos

### Windows portable app

Run `npm run build:portable` on Windows to create a standalone executable in `release/`.
The executable includes the app and device assets; no local web server or installation is needed.
Project settings are kept in a `MonkrPortableData` folder beside the executable. Move that
folder with the executable to carry your settings to another computer. Online features such
as Unsplash images, downloaded fonts, and video encoding still require an internet connection.

For maximum still-image quality, choose PNG and 4x in Export. **Preserve original uploads
between sessions** is enabled by default and stores uploaded image bytes without the older
autosave resize/JPEG conversion. Images already saved by an older version must be uploaded
again to recover their original detail. The mockup is still rasterized at the chosen output
size, so 4x creates more pixels than 1x or 2x; PNG encoding itself is lossless.

### Scene Presets

One-click layouts that look professional instantly:

- **Single device** - Hero shots, centered, tilted
- **Duo layouts** - Side by side, overlapping, responsive pairs
- **Multi-device** - Fan spreads, perspective rows, cascades
- **Ecosystem** - Full Apple lineup in one shot
- **App Store** - Pre-configured multi-slide layouts for iPhone and iPad

### App Store Screenshot Mode

Built specifically for shipping apps:

- Toggle App Store mode and pick your platform (iPhone 6.7", 6.1", iPad 12.9", 11")
- Canvas automatically sizes to App Store guidelines
- Choose 1-10 sections that split the canvas into slides
- Design across all slides using the same tools
- Export slices each section into a separate screenshot
- Visual divider lines and section labels keep you oriented

### Text Overlays

- Multiple font families with weight control (100-900)
- Alignment, letter spacing, and line height
- Text shadow with color, blur, and offset
- **Arc text** for curved headlines
- Position above, below, or anywhere on canvas
- 3D tilt and rotation

### Animation & Video Export

Create animated mockups and export as video:

- **7 animation presets** - Full Spin, Rock, Tilt Showcase, Float, Zoom Pulse, Slide In, Rise
- Adjustable duration and FPS
- Loop support
- Export as **MP4** (H.264), **MOV**, or **WebM** (VP9)
- Powered by FFmpeg WASM - encoding happens entirely in your browser

### Export Options

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **PNG** | Lossless quality, transparency support |
| **JPG** | Smaller files, great for web — no alpha channel, so it's disabled while Background is "None" |
| **MP4** | Animated mockups, social media |
| **MOV** | QuickTime-compatible video |
| **WebM** | Web-optimized video |

All image exports support **1x, 2x, and 3x** scale for retina-quality output. One-click **copy to clipboard** for quick sharing.

### Device Customization

Every device on the canvas can be individually tuned:

- **Position** - Drag or use precise X/Y controls
- **Scale** - Pinch or slider from tiny to oversized
- **Rotation** - Free rotation in degrees
- **3D Tilt** - Perspective tilt on X and Y axes
- **Shadow** - Color, blur, spread, and offset
- **Glow** - Edge glow with customizable color and intensity
- **Frame style** - Full device frame, outline only, or frameless

### Layout Templates

20+ arrangement templates for multi-device compositions:

- Single Center, Tilted, Hero Left/Right
- Side by Side, Overlap, Stacked
- Fan, Cascade, Perspective Row
- Grid 2x2, Scattered, Isometric
- Phone+Tablet, Laptop+Phone, Floating Stack
- Showcase 5 and more

### Canvas Presets

Pre-configured sizes for every platform:

- **General** - 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, Ultrawide
- **Social** - Dribbble, Twitter, Instagram (Post & Story), LinkedIn, Product Hunt, Open Graph
- **App Store** - All iPhone sizes, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch (46mm & Ultra 49mm)
- **Google Play** - Phone, Tablet 7" & 10", Feature Graphic

### Quality of Life

- **Auto-save** - Your project persists in localStorage automatically
- **Import/Export** - Save and load `.monkr` project files
- **Reset** - One-click clean slate
- **Mobile friendly** - Responsive sidebar with swipe navigation
- **Zero server dependency** - Everything runs client-side

## Getting Started

### Use it now

Head to **[monkr.wemiller.com](https://monkr.wemiller.com)** and start creating.

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaineam/Monkr.git
cd Monkr
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and you're in.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # preview the build locally
```

The static build outputs to `build/` and can be deployed anywhere - GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or your own server.

### CLI rendering (headless)

Render `.monkr` projects to framed images from the command line — no clicking
through the UI. It drives Monkr's own renderer (headless Chromium + the
`/headless` route), so output is **pixel-identical to the Export button**.

```bash
npm install                         # installs Playwright (a devDependency)
npx playwright install chromium     # one-time browser download

# render a project's embedded screenshots
npm run render -- shot.monkr --out out/
#   or, if linked/installed:  monkr render shot.monkr --out out/

# swap in fresh screenshots (a folder, in name order) and re-save the .monkr
monkr render App-iphone.monkr --out out/ --save --screenshots raw/iphone/
```

One framed image is written per screenshot. Useful flags: `--save` (write the
updated `.monkr`), `--format png|jpg`, `--scale 1|2|3`, `--build` (force a
rebuild first), and `--device/--color/--canvas` to synthesize a default frame
when no `.monkr` exists yet. Run `monkr render --help` for the full list. The
CLI auto-builds the static site on first use and rebuilds automatically when
`src/` has changed since the last build. Implemented in `bin/monkr.mjs` +
`cli/render.mjs`, backed by the headless route at `src/routes/headless/`.

### CLI animation (headless video)

`monkr animate` plays Monkr's animation presets over a project and writes a
video, using the same renderer frame by frame and the system `ffmpeg`
(`brew install ffmpeg`) for H.264 encoding. Presets can be **chained**, which
is what short social clips (YouTube Shorts, Reels) need: an entrance, then a
loop.

```bash
# rise in from below, then float for the rest of a 7-second 9:16 clip
monkr animate short.monkr --out short.mp4 --duration 7000 --relative \
  --sequence "rise@0:1400,float@1400:7000"
```

`--sequence` takes `preset@start:end` steps in milliseconds (a bare preset name
runs the whole clip). A step longer than its preset repeats whole cycles, and a
step that continues a property picks up where the previous one ended, so chains
never jump. `--relative` applies presets as offsets from each device's own
position and pose, instead of the editor's absolute values, so a composed layout
keeps its composition. Other flags: `--fps`, `--silent-audio` (adds a silent AAC
track), `--build`.

Add music with [Tom](https://github.com/blaineam/Tom), a seeded music machine:
`--music synthwave` (or `--music "chip:#road-trip"` for a specific,
shareable tune) scores the clip with a Tom jingle whose final hit lands at
`--music-hit` ms (default: 74% of the clip). Tom is optional. Monkr finds it via
`TOM_BIN` or `tom` on your PATH, and only needs it when you ask for music. Implemented in `cli/animate.mjs`; the chaining and relative
math live in `src/lib/animation.ts` (`buildSequenceTracks`, `resolveTrackValue`).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/cool-thing`)
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/cool-thing`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Before opening a PR:

- `npm test` — unit + headless end-to-end tests. The e2e tests drive a real
  Chromium (`npx playwright install chromium` once); they skip when no browser
  is installed.
- `npm run check` — `svelte-check` must report no errors.

CI runs the same two commands on every pull request. For larger changes, open
an issue first so the approach can be discussed before you build it.
